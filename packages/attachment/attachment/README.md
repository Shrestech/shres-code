# @shres-code/shres-code-attachment

The durable attachment seam. `ctx.attachments` validates and durably commits a provider-independent normalized image, then returns a serializable `ImageAttachmentRef`; consumers never persist browser paths, object URLs, provider URLs, or base64 in session events.

Unsent composer images remain browser-owned temporary drafts. `validateImage` runs the complete admission policy without persisting. `saveImages` owns batch count and aggregate-byte limits, prepares every normalized attachment before publishing any member, then commits in order and returns references only after the complete batch succeeds. `saveImage` commits one accepted image before any model-visible session event is published. When normalization reduces the raster, the reference records the orientation-applied input size in `originalDimensions`. `readImage` verifies the normalized attachment against its logged metadata. `readImageRequest` deterministically derives a route-sized request version whose identity covers the attachment id, transform version, pixel and byte budgets, and encoder settings. Callers may cancel reads and projections; implementations preserve cancellation instead of translating it into a storage failure.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the role-neutral core `ImageBlock` and provider adapters that resolve its durable reference.

#### KV Cache effect

Adding an image changes the provider request and therefore invalidates the affected request suffix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Version one accepts PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF only.
- Retention and garbage collection are deferred because resumed and forked sessions may share immutable objects.
- Generic files, audio, video, and persistent unsent drafts require separate lifecycle and provider contracts.
