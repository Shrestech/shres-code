# Subsystems

One page per subsystem of the Shres Code: what it is, the data structures it moves, and — where a `ctx` service or event scope backs it — a generated **Cordis API** section carrying its service and event reference. The folder complements [architecture.md](../architecture.md), which describes *behavior* across subsystems (the service map, the session/turn/step lifecycle, the event taxonomy); each page here is the reference for one subsystem's vocabulary and wiring.

> Type declarations and their JSDoc on these pages are source-equivalent and drift-checked by `pnpm run verify-type-equiv` (see [development.md](../development.md#documenting-types-verbatim-ts-type-equiv)). Ordinary blocks preserve complete declarations; `public-api` blocks preserve body-stripped public class declarations. Cordis services and events use each page's generated **Cordis API** section.
